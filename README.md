# About the Bank Challenge

---

The Bank challenge is the second part of a series of challenges set by Digital Futures to test my working knowledge on the concepts learned so far on the Digital Futures Academy. In preparation for this challenge, some of the concepts learned include: Software Development Lifecycles, Test Driven Development, Testing Frameworks, Domain Modelling and Object Oriented Design & Testing.

In my approach to this challenge, I wanted a client or bank manager to be able to simply create a transaction that will be added to the user account by calling a `newTransaction` method on the instance of the Client class and passing in an `id`, `transaction type`, `transaction amount` and a `date`.

Transactions are then added to the user's `transaction history` as transaction objects that hold store the properties mentioned above.

When a client wants to print their statement, they simply call a `printStatement` method on the instance of their Client class and pass in the `Printer` class as a parameter. The program then iterates through the client's past transactions and displays them in order of latest transaction first. The program also formats their `credits` as green and `withdrawals` as red.

I have also added functionality that prevents the client from withdrawing money that they do not have in their balance. An error will be thrown instead.

# Built with

---

The code that forms the solution for this challenge was written in Javascript, and tested using the Jasmine testing framework and custom spec files written myself, to satisfy the user stories provided..

# Getting Started

---

## Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    - Or install using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node)
- [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)

## Installation:

- Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/mardeldev/bank-challenge.git`

- Enter directory

`cd bank-challenge`

- Setup Jasmine testing framework. Set entry point to `index.js` and the test command to `jamsmine` when prompted. Then open `package.json` and add a new key:value pair of `type : "module"`.

`npm init
npm i --save-dev jasmine
npx jasmine init`

- Enter the `src` directory

`cd src/`

- Run `index.js` from the terminal

`node index.js`

- To run the tests, run `npm test` from the terminal

## Project Structure:

- The index file and classes are found in the `src` directory.
- Spec/test files are found in the `spec` directory.

# Problem Statements

---

### Requirements

- Results of your code should display via the JavaScript console. (NB: You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes user input from STDIN.)
- Deposits, withdrawal.
- Account statement (date, credit or debit amount, balance) printing.
- Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012

**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012

**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012

**When** she prints her bank statement

**Then** she would see

```
date       || credit  || debit  || balance
14/01/2012 ||         || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 ||        || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 ||        || 1000.00
```

Credited values should be GREEN and debited values should be RED. The balance should be GREEN if positive and RED if negative

### Review
[y] Have you written a README explaining your approach, perhaps a domain model, instructions to install, run app, run tests, and examples of interactions?

[y] Did you start with a feature test first? -> I wrote failing tests first and then refactored code to pass them.

[y] Do all your tests pass? (How do you know?) -> Yes. when I run `npm test`, it shows all tests as having passed.

[y] Does your program have sufficient test coverage? (How do you know?) -> I have written tests that test the functionality and some erroneous cases such as if a client wants to withdraw money that they do not have in their account.

[y] Have you linted your code? (How do you know?) -> I ran `es lint` on each source code file and it came back with no errors.

[y] Do you have 3 or more classes?

[y] Are your methods no longer than 5 lines?

[y] Is the complexity of your methods low? (How do you know?) -> I have adopted a single 

[y] Are all parts of the statement format in presentation-specific classes? (Statement, lineItem etc)

[y] Have you encapsulated transaction data in a class?

[y] Have you encapsulated adding to the transactions array in a class?

[y] Are all your class dependencies (even Date? (!)) injected rather than hard-coded?

[y] Are all your unit tests isolated?

`y` means yes.
